## Adding a new file
When you create a new file in the teamcode folder, Android Studio will ask you if you want to add the new file to the repository.  This will set the file to be uploaded to GitHub, so you should do this.  If you click "no" you can always go to the **VCS** menu and add the file to the repository later.  

Notice that the new file will be highlighted green in the sidebar.  This shows you that the file only exists on your computer and is not yet in the repository on GitHub.

## Commit your changes to the repository
You can edit code on your computer all you want.  When you have some working code or are ready to share your code with the team.  Click on the **VCS** menu and click **Commit**.  Write a little message to the team to let everyone know what your new file does or what your changes to existing files were.  Then click **Commit** and your work will be uploaded to GitHub.
